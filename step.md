# Step-by-Step Development Plan for Prompt Library

## Overview

This document outlines a detailed, incremental approach to building the Prompt Library application. Each step results in a functional application with testable features. The plan follows a "vertical slice" approach, implementing complete features one at a time rather than building all components of a single layer before moving to the next.

## Step 1: Project Setup and Basic Layout

**Goal**: Create a basic application shell with navigation structure.

1. **Set up Firebase configuration**
   - Initialize Firebase in your project
   - Set up environment variables for Firebase credentials
   - Test Firebase connection

2. **Create the basic layout components**
   - Implement a main layout with header, content area, and footer
   - Create a responsive navigation bar with placeholder links
   - Add a simple home page with project description

3. **Implement basic routing**
   - Set up React Router with routes for Home, Login, and Register pages
   - Create placeholder pages for each route
   - Implement navigation between pages

**Testing**: Verify navigation works correctly and the layout is responsive.

## Step 2: Authentication System

**Goal**: Implement a complete authentication flow.

1. **Create authentication service**
   - Implement Firebase authentication methods (sign up, sign in, sign out)
   - Create custom hooks for authentication state
   - Set up user context/state with Jotai

2. **Build login and registration forms**
   - Create form components with validation using Zod
   - Implement error handling and loading states
   - Style forms using Material UI components

3. **Add authentication state to the layout**
   - Update navigation to show user status
   - Implement protected routes for authenticated users
   - Add user dropdown menu in the header

**Testing**: Register a new account, log in, log out, and verify protected routes work correctly.

## Step 3: User Profile

**Goal**: Allow users to view and edit their profile information.

1. **Create user data model and service**
   - Define user interface in TypeScript
   - Implement Firestore service for user data
   - Create hooks for user data management

2. **Build profile page**
   - Create a user profile page with user information
   - Implement profile editing functionality
   - Add profile picture upload with Firebase Storage

3. **Implement user settings**
   - Add theme preference (light/dark mode)
   - Create settings page with user preferences
   - Store user preferences in Firestore

**Testing**: Update profile information, change settings, and verify data persistence.

## Step 4: Basic Prompt Management

**Goal**: Implement core CRUD operations for prompts.

1. **Create prompt data model and service**
   - Define prompt interface in TypeScript
   - Implement Firestore service for prompt data
   - Create hooks for prompt data management

2. **Build prompt creation form**
   - Create a form for adding new prompts
   - Implement markdown editor with preview
   - Add validation for prompt fields

3. **Implement prompt listing**
   - Create a component to display prompt cards
   - Build a page to list user's prompts
   - Implement prompt deletion functionality

4. **Add prompt detail view**
   - Create a page to view prompt details
   - Implement prompt editing functionality
   - Add copy-to-clipboard feature for prompt content

**Testing**: Create, view, edit, and delete prompts. Test copy-to-clipboard functionality.

## Step 5: Tags and Categories

**Goal**: Add organization capabilities to prompts.

1. **Extend prompt model with tags and categories**
   - Update prompt interface to include tags and categories
   - Modify Firestore service to handle the new fields
   - Create services for managing tags and categories

2. **Build tag management UI**
   - Create components for displaying and selecting tags
   - Implement tag creation and deletion
   - Add tag input to prompt creation/editing forms

3. **Implement category system**
   - Create predefined categories or allow custom categories
   - Add category selection to prompt forms
   - Update prompt listing to show categories

4. **Add filtering and sorting**
   - Implement filtering by tags and categories
   - Add sort options (date, name, etc.)
   - Create a search bar for finding prompts

**Testing**: Add tags to prompts, filter by tags, change categories, and search for prompts.

## Step 6: Prompt Sharing

**Goal**: Allow users to share prompts with others.

1. **Update prompt model for sharing**
   - Add visibility field (public/private) to prompt interface
   - Implement Firestore rules for public/private access
   - Update prompt service to handle visibility

2. **Create public prompt view**
   - Build a page for viewing public prompts
   - Implement public prompt listing
   - Add "Featured" or "Popular" sections

3. **Add sharing functionality**
   - Implement shareable links for prompts
   - Create a "Share" button with copy-to-clipboard
   - Add social media sharing options

4. **Implement prompt forking**
   - Allow users to copy (fork) public prompts to their collection
   - Track original prompt and attribution
   - Show fork count on prompt details

**Testing**: Make prompts public, share links, view public prompts, and fork prompts.

## Step 7: Advanced Features and Optimizations

**Goal**: Enhance the application with additional features and performance improvements.

1. **Implement collections**
   - Allow users to create prompt collections
   - Build UI for managing collections
   - Add drag-and-drop for organizing prompts

2. **Add favorites system**
   - Implement functionality to mark prompts as favorites
   - Create a favorites page
   - Add sorting by popularity

3. **Optimize performance**
   - Implement pagination for prompt listings
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize Firestore queries with proper indexing

4. **Enhance the UI**
   - Implement dark/light mode toggle
   - Add animations and transitions
   - Improve mobile responsiveness

**Testing**: Create collections, favorite prompts, check performance with many prompts, and test on mobile devices.

## Step 8: Final Polish and Deployment

**Goal**: Finalize the application and prepare for production deployment.

1. **Comprehensive testing**
   - Test all features across different browsers
   - Verify mobile responsiveness
   - Fix any remaining bugs

2. **Add analytics and monitoring**
   - Implement Firebase Analytics
   - Add error logging and monitoring
   - Set up performance monitoring

3. **Optimize for production**
   - Configure proper Firestore indexes
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Set up proper caching strategies

4. **Deploy to production**
   - Configure Firebase Hosting for production
   - Update security rules for production
   - Set up automated deployment with CI/CD

**Testing**: Perform end-to-end testing of the entire application flow.

## Conclusion

This step-by-step plan allows for incremental development of the Prompt Library application, with each step building on the previous ones and resulting in a functional product. By following this approach, you can test features as they're implemented and gather feedback early in the development process.

Remember to commit your code frequently and consider setting up a staging environment for testing before deploying to production. Good luck with your project!
